The case sensitive Neo4j node index name that you want to query.\r\n2. The valid lucene query that you want to use to query the supplied index.\r\n3. The relationship name that will be used to determine the number of incoming links to each node you are querying for. Leave blank if you want to query all incoming links regardless of relationship type.\r\n4. The label property name for each of your Neo4j nodes. See method summary for details.\r\n5. Skip a number of a nodes, ordered by the Neo4j assigned node id of each node you are querying for. Use this for processing batches on large graph queries.\r\n6. Limit the number of results you would like returned. Use this in combination with the skip property to process batches on large graph queries.\r\n7. Returns a list of nodes that implements IGraphNode interface, having a label and size property for ranking result order.\r\n\r\nUse the IndexAutoCompleteKey method in the Processor class to index the autocomplete keys to blob storage uri.\r\n\r\nYour URI to the JSON file index will be: \r\n\r\nhttp://BLOB_STORAGE_NAME.blob.core.windows.net/BLOB_STORAGE_CONTAINER_ID/cache/PARTIAL_SEARCH_QUERY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-44372809-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
